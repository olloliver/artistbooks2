kerning has been adjusted to transition the text from individual characters towards 
more asemic expressions to be viewed as imagery, rather than text. My intention for

spring of 2020, Characters, an ongoing series where I disguise myself as different 
exaggerated forms of my own identity, allows me to explore and catalog different 
aspects of my own gender and sexuality— posing as everyone from the brother 
I’ve never had, or could be, to a fisher, to a sort of disgraced Mary, ultimate symbol 
of maternity and innocence.

 

The creation of these characters has also become part of the work, as I shoot 
myself getting into character, and secretly make the images in my childhood home. 
Partial or incomplete costumes are essential, as the recognition of self is crucial in 
emphasizing the performance and indulgence of the photo and character— 
while also giving a nod to others in rural or inaccessible areas that must make 
due with what they’ve got to express themselves. The posturing and physicality 
that possesses me as I complete these disguises continues to be of interest and 
I consider this series to be limitless.
